# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating Terraform Infrastructure as Code (IaC) that automatically retrieves Cloudflare's IP address ranges and creates an AWS Security Group with rules that whitelist these IP addresses. This enables secure communication between AWS resources and Cloudflare services by allowing traffic only from verified Cloudflare IP ranges.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to automatically retrieve Cloudflare IP addresses and create AWS security group rules, so that I can ensure only legitimate Cloudflare traffic can reach my AWS resources without manual IP management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Terraform configuration is applied THEN the system SHALL retrieve current Cloudflare IPv4 and IPv6 address ranges from Cloudflare's official API
2. WHEN Cloudflare IP addresses are retrieved THEN the system SHALL create an AWS Security Group with ingress rules for each IP range
3. WHEN the security group is created THEN it SHALL include rules for HTTPS (port 443) traffic over TCP protocol
4. IF the Terraform apply fails due to API issues THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the failure reason

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the security group to be properly tagged and documented, so that I can easily identify and manage the Cloudflare whitelist security group in my AWS environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the security group is created THEN it SHALL include descriptive tags identifying it as a Cloudflare IP whitelist
2. WHEN the security group is created THEN it SHALL have a clear name and description indicating its purpose
3. WHEN viewing the security group in AWS console THEN administrators SHALL be able to identify it as Cloudflare-related through naming and tags

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the Terraform configuration to be idempotent and handle updates, so that I can safely re-run the configuration when Cloudflare IP ranges change.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Terraform is run multiple times THEN it SHALL only make changes if Cloudflare IP ranges have been updated
2. WHEN Cloudflare adds or removes IP ranges THEN the security group SHALL be updated to reflect the current IP list
3. WHEN the configuration is destroyed THEN all created AWS resources SHALL be properly cleaned up
4. IF there are existing security group rules THEN the system SHALL replace them with the current Cloudflare IP ranges

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the IP ranges to be automatically updated on a schedule, so that my security group stays current with Cloudflare's IP changes without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the infrastructure is deployed THEN it SHALL include automation to periodically check for Cloudflare IP updates
2. WHEN Cloudflare IP ranges change THEN the system SHALL automatically update the security group within a configurable time window
3. WHEN setting up the automation THEN users SHALL be able to configure the update frequency through Terraform variables
4. WHEN the automated update runs THEN it SHALL log the changes and notify administrators of any updates made
5. IF the automated update fails THEN the system SHALL send alerts to administrators about the failure

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want the solution to be configurable for different ports and protocols, so that I can adapt it for various use cases beyond just HTTP/HTTPS traffic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the Terraform module THEN users SHALL be able to specify custom ports through variables
2. WHEN configuring the Terraform module THEN users SHALL be able to specify protocols (TCP/UDP) through variables
3. WHEN no custom configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL default to HTTPS (443) over TCP
4. WHEN custom ports are specified THEN the security group SHALL create rules for those ports instead of defaults
